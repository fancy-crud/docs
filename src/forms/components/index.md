# Components

The form related functionality is encapsulated in four distinct components, each serving a specific purpose to enhance form rendering and user interaction. You can import them from `@fancy-crud/vue`

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { FForm, FFormHeader, FFormBody, FFormFooter } from '@fancy-crud/vue'
</script>
```

<!--@include: ./form-header.md -->

<!--@include: ./form-body.md -->

<!--@include: ./form-footer.md -->

<!--@include: ./form-container.md -->
